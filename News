10/26/2016 Version 0.9.46

        Updated bos_vrmf_map

09/23/2016 Version 0.9.44

        Changed output of entitlement from integer to real.

09/22/2016 Version 0.9.43

        Added a check for mismatched bridge modes between SEAs using
        the same pvid+vswitch for their control packets.  e.g. a SEA
        with a bridge mode of partial should have its mate also in
        partial bridge mode or something is wrong.

09/07/2016 Version 0.9.39

	Added a log file that records date, user, arguments, and exit
	status.  If an error is thrown, the stack and error message is
	recorded.
	
09/07/2016 Version 0.9.38

	Fixed a crash if more than one snap is sucked up at the same
	time.  An error message is printed that I hope wlil be easier
	to understand.
	
09/07/2016 Version 0.9.37

	Changed NetstatV::Parsers.instance.add to also take a pattern
	to avoid constantly needing to add entries for fiber channel
	adapters.  The patterns are searched first and then the table
	of strings is used.

06/03/2016 Version 0.9.34

	Updated README.  Changed snap and batch processors to accept
	the options mostly so the level specified on the command line
	would be available.

05/19/2016 Version 0.9.32

	Discovered that "Control" buffers alert came out too often.
	Added "drops" and "dropped" to the list of default entstat
	lines that are printed at the default level.

04/26/2016 Version 0.9.30

	When snapper barfs and dies, the error messages are now much
	nicer and I am hoping more understandable by the users.

03/08/2016 Version 0.9.21

	Jim noticed that in his snap, the SMT did not display
	correctly.  I guess I have to get the SMT enabled and SMT
	threads from the attributes of proc0.

03/08/2016 Version 0.9.20

	Added tests to SEA.
	
	6. Sanity check bridge mode is All when State is PRIMARY.  Also
	   bridge mode should be Partial when State is PRIMARY_SH or
	   BACKUP_SH.

	7. Check VEAs are active

	   a. If bridge mode is All, then all the VEAs should be active.

	   b. If bridge mode is Partial, then the VEAs for the VID
	      shared list should be active.

	   c. If bridge mode is None, then all VEAs should have active
	      set to false.

01/29/2016 Version 0.9.19

	Add alerts to the snap if an fscsi device does not have
	fc_err_recov set to fast_fail or dyntrk set to yes.

01/26/2016 Version 0.9.14

	Added mode of the etherchannel (Bob's suggestion)

	Added number of virtual CPUs and SMT mode to the LPAR output.
	
	Added alerts if 802.3ad ether channel Partner System attribute
	in the entstat does not match across all of the adapters in
	the ether channel.  Similarly, allert for Partner Operational
	Key.  I started adding a testcase for this but it was too much
	work for too little gain.
	
	Flag devices which are in Defined state.  SEAs are always
	reported even if they are defined and children of containers
	are always reported even if they are defined.  This helps
	users notice that something is amiss with these devices.

01/09/2016 Version 0.9.7

	Added parsing of lslpp -lc found in general.snap.  Added
	bos_vrmf_map to distribution.  Added parsing of VIOS.level.
	Now the Snap output line looks something like:

	Snap dir:test.snap time:07/17/13 08:17:34 level:6100-08-02 VIOS:2.2.2.2

	providing the basename of where the snap was found, the time
	of the snap, the AIX level, and VIOS level.

	Also added printing of News from command line.

01/06/2016 Version 0.9.3

	Deferred processing of lsattr to speed up execution of snaps
	with a large number of lsattr -El hdiskNNNN entries.

01/02/2016 Version 0.9.0

	Added pager and coloring options
    
	Added --color, --o-color, --paginate, --pager, and --no-pager
	options as well as hooking up to less.

01/01/2016

	Fixed / redid print levels.

	I reworked the print levels.  They now go fro 0 to 11 instead
	of -1 to 11.  The default is now 3.  level 1 is for alerts
	only.

	Also incorporated Print feature into CEC, LPAR, and Snap so
	that their filters may now be altered by the general user.

12/28/2015

	Added many checks for SEAs.
