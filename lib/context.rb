# When an Item's print method is called, it sometimes needs some
# context.  For example, the print method of errpt wants to delete the
# duplicate entries.  Since print is for an individual errpt entry, it
# needs context of the previous calls.
#
# A Context is created and inject is used.  The print methods must
# return a context which is used in the next call.  The idiom is then
# to call done -- e.g.
#
# enumerable_of_items.inject(context.nest) { |context, item| item.print(context) }.done
