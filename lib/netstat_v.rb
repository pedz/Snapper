  # This parser splits the entire netstat -v output into pieces by
  # looking for such things as +ETHERNET STATISTICS+ This is done by
  # the DEVICE_BOUNDARY Regexp.
  #
  # Each piece is then taken as a separate entity.  The first line has
  # the device name somewhere within it (e.g. +ETHERNET STATISTICS
  # (ent1) :+ has "ent1" within it.  This provides the logical device
  # name.  In the case of ethernet, the second line is a device type
  # like +Device Type: PCIe2 2-port 10GbE SR Adapter+.

  # register with the Netstat_v parser which device types they can
  # parse.  Thus at parse time, the Netstat_v parser tries to match
  # the second line with one of the registered device types.  If a
  # match is found, a parser of that specific class is created and the
  # parsing is handed off to that instance.  If no match is found, a
  # new Entstat_generic instance is created and the parsing is handed
